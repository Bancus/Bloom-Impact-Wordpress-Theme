                         During the last several months, we've built out the technology, brought on top talent, formed strategic partnerships, met with small businesses on the ground, and more. Most importantly, we're excited to have just released the Beta version of our application which is now available for download in the Google Play Store for MSMEs in Ghana....
                         <br/>
                         We've launched our Beta Product
We are excited to announce that we released a Beta product version in the Google Play Store for our first market, Ghana. Over the next 90 days we are monitoring usage, updating features along the way, and of course correcting bugs that pop up along this innovative journey. <br/>  See a few screenshots below....<br/><br/>
92% of all Ghanaian businesses are MSMEs and they provide 70% of the GDP.<br/>  They rate efficient, transparent access to finance as their top problem, and we aim to help by digitizing access.  Our marketplace matches the needs and qualifications of business owners with the most appropriate financial products.<br/><br/>

<h4>
Who Do We Work With?
</h4>
<p>
For our Beta product we are working with several financial service providers: Affinity Microfinance, Christian Community Microfinance Limited, Bank of Africa, GN Bank and Fidelity.  Today we offer credit, savings and checking account products geared to help micro and small businesses better run their activities.
</p>
<p>
To drive adoption of our service, we have built partnerships with various organizations in Ghana that serve MSMEs. These partnerships help us reach out to small businesses to learn about their needs in accessing financial products, areas to drive financial literacy and receive first-hand feedback on our app. Through our app, we help both MSMEs find the right products and financial service providers find quality customers.
